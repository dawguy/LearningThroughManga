            Welcome to my blog. The goal is to get a good list of korean vocabulary in the context of manga. This will make both learning words more enjoyable and make remembering the words easier since they will be learnt in context.
            <br/>
            The blog section of this website will continue to be updated with listings of current manga I am reading and planned updates to the website.
            <br/>
            Welcome and thanks for reading!
